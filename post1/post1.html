                        &emsp;This might not sound like something you'd be interested in, however you may be suprised. I'm definitely not one 
                        to be singing while sober but when I'm baked I'm always singing like a god damn madman. It feels great and you should 
                        try it.

                            &emsp;Music by itself is already one of the greatest things we have and listening to music whil baked is even better, but
                            what really takes the cake is listening to music while baked in the dark. Turn on your favourite (trippy!) playlist, flip off
                            the lights and close your eyes.

                            on a hike, swim in some water, etc. Hopefully you're in a place where you can do at least one of these things.

                            &emsp;This one may be a bit abstract but hear me out. Just try doing something that you truly appreciate, even if you don't think
                            it would really match well with weed. You may be suprised. If you're an artist you may stop being such a perfectionist, if you're
                            trying to solve a problem you may find it easier to think outside the box.

                            This is absolutely one of my favourite things to do while smoking cannabis and I find that it brings the most long 
                            term satisfaction. If you don't think you've got anything that you appreciate then try picking up something new, the sky
                             is the limit.
